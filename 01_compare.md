# CURRICULUM COMPARISON for APCSA

* Curriculum Currently Taught: ProjectSTEM on Canvas platform [Link](https://courses.projectstem.org/courses/77357)
* Curriculum Comparison: CSAwesome on CodingRooms platform 

### ORGANIZATION: 
* Both platform are organized using the College Board format with 10 units.  I don't notice any major difference in content emphases.

### PEDAGOGICAL STYLE: 
* Both lead with content videos and lead to student practice coding activities.  
* ProjectSTEM's videos seem longer and a little more boring.
* CSAwesome's videos are more engaging and often feature great demonstrations/visuals to illustrate new concepts.

### CODING ENVIRONMENTS: 
* Both provide in-page coding environments on the learning pages.  
* CodingRooms provides a much higher feature set, where the teacher can see each recorded keystroke.

### EDITABLE: 
* Both platforms all teachers to add and edit existing content.  
* CodingRooms seems much easier to use than Canvas for this.

### FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS: 
* ProjectSTEM offers 1 quiz and 1 test for each unit.  They also has a second "alternate" version for each, which can be used as "practice" assessments with a detailed answer key. 
* CSAwesome has large question banks that align more closely to the AP exam of "easy", "medium", and "hard" multiple choice questions,  that can be packaged by the teacher into "assignments"

### TEACHER GRADING TOOLS:
* ProjectSTEM auto-grades all progress, and provides a downloadable .csv file. 
* CodingRooms also has a gradebook page, but includes much more functionality in examining 1 specific assessment or looking at live coding from students.

### INSPIRATIONAL:
* ProjectSTEM offers CS professionals to do a virtual visit to the classroom (which I love!). They also have some content connections to Amazon's AWS service (which I had difficulty using).
* CSAwesome has a whole Unit 16 with stories about meeting CS professionals from diverse backgrounds.


## TAKEAWAYS:
* I definitely want to integrate parts of CSAwesome into my curriculum this year, particularly the videos that incorporate new content.  
* There are also great "Rearrange the Code Blocks" activities that ProjectSTEM does not offer as well.
* Also, I want to offer students to complete CSAwesome lessons as an alternative if they struggle in a particular unit in ProjectSTEM (ie. if students get less than a 70 on a Unit Test?)
