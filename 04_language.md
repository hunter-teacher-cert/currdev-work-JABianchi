# CS Language Analysis

## What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
* AP Computer Science A
* 10th - 12th Grade
* Students have developed deep programming skills in Java throughout the year

## What is the language?
* Processing
    * See [Processing website](https://processing.org/)
    * See [example Processing project](https://processing.org/examples/setupdraw.html)

## How does one write & run code in this language?
Processing comes with an IDE which can run and display the visualizations natively.
Processing also has a very easy to read [Reference guide](https://processing.org/reference/).  My only complaint is that Java is very type dependent, and the documentation doesn't easily show the return data types for methods.
All Processing programs are required to have a ```setup()``` method which occurs is executed one time, and a ```draw()``` method which repeats infinitely. (This is very similar to the Arduino language setup, which derives from Processing).
Code is written in Java, using the available Processing methods.

## Strengths
Processing is a great language for creating graphics.  It is much simpler than using the Java AWT or Swing libraries.  
Another huge strength is how easily a student can get visual feedback about logic errors in their code (in contrast to only ever seeing text in the output console).

One of the challenges in APCSA is that with such an intense Java focus, students can easily become disengaged with the technical challenges and problems that are purely text-based.  Providing graphical challenges that utilize Processing can be very helpful.

## Weaknesses
Students will need to take additional time to understand the graphics framework, becoming familiar with the x-y-coordinate grid for the pixels. Students can be easily confused by the differences between computer graphics and the Cartesian coordinate system.

Additionally, Processing is a large download, and it may take class time and troubleshooting to get the libraries installed on the students' computers.  I have not found a solution yet that allows for using Processing with Java on Chromebooks.
