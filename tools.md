```Describe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:
The name of the tool.
What its general purpose is.
The class(es) you use it in.
How you use it in class.
Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?```

## TECH TOOL #1: REPLIT Classrooms
* Purpose: Online code editor that can handle multiple languages, packaged in a "classroom" environment with evolving teacher tools embedded
* Classes Used In: AP Computer Science A
* How Used In Class: I use this to supplement other assignments and for APCSA Labs.  I will type up starter code, and provide a markdown file with instructions.  I can choose to "publish" the assignment at any given time.  I can choose to group students into groups if desired, (ie. dual programming)
* Why selected:  I want to be able to give students unique coding challenges that I can create and assign easily.  Also, I love the features that I can see the code they are typing live (and even see a code history of their work).  It is effective for quick 5 minute challenges OR even longer APCSA lab work.



## TECH TOOL #2: Arduino Web Editor
* Purpose: Online IDE that students can type code, check code, save code, generate a shareable link to code for physical computing with the Arduino microcontroller
* Classes Used In: Arduino Engineering Class
* How Used In Class: Students use in day-to-day coding challenges.  Students need to use it to type & test their programs.  At the end, they need to share a link to their code in Google Classroom
* Why selected: Arduino was chosen in general because of its cheap, open-source platform for embedded electronics.  Arduino offers a desktop IDE that can be a pain for all students to install on their laptops.  Also, the code they save is local and I have had headaches with students losing their files if they weren't automatically saved online.  It makes it very easy for them to share a link and I can provide feedback to them about their code.
